  # a list of packages in the format <package-name>==<version>
  # NOTE: Installing pip packages here, in combination with Conda packages installed in the 'run' section, is largely untested.
  #       It relies on the assumption that the pip packages are compatible with the Python version and the Conda environment.
  #       Use this feature with caution, as it may lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.
  #       If possible, try to install all required packages using Conda in the 'run' section for better reproducibility.
